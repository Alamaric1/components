# Contribution Guide
## Create a Ticket
Reporting an issue or making a feature request is a great way to contribute. Your feedback and the conversations that result from it provide a continuous flow of ideas.

Before you create a ticket, please take the time to research first.

If creating a ticket, please provide a self-sufficient description in the ticket. We understand this is extra work but the issue tracker is an important place of record for design discussions and decisions that can often be referenced long after the fix version, for example to revisit decisions, to understand the origin of a feature, and so on. i


## Source Code Style
To format code in this project we use the [styleguide](https://github.com/google/styleguide) goole provides.
Actually there is no coding guideline right now  but at least the coding conventions of [Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/codeconvtoc-136057.html) should be applied.
To get a better test coverage, provide tests to new features as they are implemented.
